  <h1>Introducing My Pets</h1>
  <img src ="media/together.jpg" alt="Ziggy and Elf">
  <p>In early December 2021, after having just completed finals week, I made the spontenous decision to become a pet owner. Petrified of cats, and knowing that my space is too small for a dog, I opted for... a PARAKEET! I came home that day with Elf, whose quiet demeanor made me question the plausability that I had just adopted a sad and lonely bird. With guilt I decided to rectify the situation, and the next day came home with Ziggy (polar opposites) and the house has not experience a quiet day since. The two are like an old married couple, can't live together and can't live without one another.</p>
  <h1>Elf!</h1>
   <section>
    <h3><u>Physical Traits:</u> Green and Smaller Built</h3>
    <h3><u>Personality Traits:</u> Intelligent, Quiet, Completative, Alpha-Budgie</h3>
      <p>Elf is the quiet bird who would much rather observe. When new treats are introduced Elf waits for Ziggy to eat first, presumebly to confirm it's safe. Elf is moody, they like to be petted but only when they want to, otherwise I'm likely to get bit. Elf is a very percise flyer and seems to do a great job returning to their birdcage when told.</p>

  <h1>Ziggy!</h1>
  <section>
    <h3><u>Physical Traits:</u> Blue and Puddgy</h3>
    <h3><u>Personality Traits:</u> Loud, Confused, High Energy</h3>
      <p>Ziggy as the name suggests is quite literally all over the place. Once let out Ziggy happily flies from one side of the house to another with such excitement that no object is safe. If you were to hear a loud thud, it's likely the sound of Ziggy flying into a wall or window. At times Ziggy's shock at crashing into something results in forgetting that they are a bird, instead of flying back to the birdcage, Ziggy instead chooses to waddle across a room just to reach the birdcage</p>
